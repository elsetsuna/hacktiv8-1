# Hacktiv8 Phase 0 Week 4: Logics in JavaScript

In this fourth week, we will focus on honing our logic and programming by continuing to work on challenges.

:bulb: **Guidance:**
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **Reference** is a material for your learning reference. In some readings, there is a direction that asks you to make something. Direction is more optional to help you.
- :anchor: **Anchor** is a task or challenge that you must do and collect.
- ðŸ’ª **Self Training** is an optional task that it isn't collected. If you finish it well, the learning will be maximal!
- :rocket: **Rocket** is an optional challenge that tests your greatness as a future developer candidate
- :books: **Optional Reference** s a reference as an additional reference that will enrich your knowledge
