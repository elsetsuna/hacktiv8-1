# Hacktiv8 Phase 0 Week 3: Arrays and Logics

In this third week, we will train our understanding of logic and its implementation in various cases.

:bulb: **Guidance:**
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **Reference** is a material for your learning reference. In some readings, there is a direction that asks you to make something. Direction is more optional to help you.
- :anchor: **Anchor** is a task or challenge that you must do and collect.
- ðŸ’ª **Self Training** is an optional task that it isn't collected. If you finish it well, the learning will be maximal!
- :rocket: **Rocket** is an optional challenge that tests your greatness as a future developer candidate
- :books: **Optional Reference** s a reference as an additional reference that will enrich your knowledge

## Wednesday, 10 July 2019 - Logic Challenges Refresh
Take a moment to get acquainted with Node.js, a platform that allows you to run JavaScript scripts on the server. So, you can easily create JavaScript code that can run in your terminal. Today, you will try to directly implement your code via Node.js!
